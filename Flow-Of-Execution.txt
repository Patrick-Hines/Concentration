Concentration Game Flow of Execution:

Card Class:
	-This class is only here to repaint panels. That's all.
		Defaults: 
			flipped = false; //Show image when true
			matched = false; //Show Dark Blue when true
			active = false; //Show Gray when false, blue if true



Base Program:

	1. "New Game" is clicked 
			-Sends the proper dimensions to CardPanel
			-Make CardPanel draw up the appropriate images

	2. CardPanel reads the dimensions and pulls in the appropriate amount of images
		-Test point: System.out the resulting imagepaths

	3. CardPanel shuffles these images
		-Test point: System.out the resulting imagepaths

	4. CardPanel sets those images to the cards within the dimensions, then marks them as "active = true"

	5. On panel click (All done in Card Panel), set the flipped property to "true" and "flippedCards" to "+1" and "cardReference1" to the clicked card.

	6. On second panel click, set flipped property to "true" and "flippedCards" to "+1" and "cardReference2" to the clicked card

	7. If "flippedCards" = 2, then send both "cardReference" object to compareCards() method in CardPanel.
		-Returns Boolean
		-compareCards is called as the condition statement for an if() within the actionPerformed of the card clicking ActionListener
			-If true, then set both cards to "matched = true" and check to see if any other cards are "matched = false"
				-If no other cards are "matched = false", then the game is over.














Test Method:

public void test(String input) {
	System.out.println(input);
}
